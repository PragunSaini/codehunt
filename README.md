# CodeHunt


Website made for my second semester web development project.
Made it to practice my JS and CSS, and learn how to use a NodeJS backend with Express.

The website is hosted at : [CodeHunt](http://codehunt.cf "The site is hosted here")

## Technologies used
1. CSS/HTML
2. Javascript
3. NodeJS
4. ExpressJS
5. Firebase (database, authentication and hosting)

### Things to work on
- Since it was my first try at a backend, the website just logs a single user across all instances, whether you open it on your pc or someone else's. Need to implement Express Sessions here.

- The upvoted links are not being updated in any file and as such all information will disappear if the server crashes.
